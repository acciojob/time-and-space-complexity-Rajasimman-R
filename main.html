<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

<p>
  Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that measures how the running time of an algorithm or program grows as the input size increases. It helps us analyze the efficiency of algorithms and make informed decisions about which algorithm to use for a particular problem. An algorithm is considered efficient if it can handle larger inputs without a significant increase in execution time.

  <b>Space complexity</b>, on the other hand, focuses on the amount of memory space that an algorithm or program requires to solve a problem. It is particularly important in situations where memory resources are limited, such as in embedded systems or mobile devices. One common way to express space complexity is using Big O notation, denoted as O(f(n)), where 'n' represents the input size. For example, an algorithm with O(n) space complexity indicates that the amount of memory used by the algorithm grows linearly with the input size.
